different between : sources.yml , schema.yml, profiles.yml,dbt_project.yml?
📁 1. profiles.yml
🎯 Purpose: Where and how dbt connects to your data platform (e.g., BigQuery).
putting "dev", "staging", "prod"

📁 2. dbt_project.yml
🎯 Purpose: Project-wide configuration — name, structure, defaults.
📦 Scope: Project-specific — always committed to Git. Defines how your project is built.
putting the "staging" , "core" and "matrs"

📁 3. sources.yml
🎯 Purpose: Document and test your raw input data — the “source of truth”.
📍 Location: Typically in models/ or models/sources/ — committed to Git.

📁 4. schema.yml
Purpose: schema.yml is your data contract + documentation engine
🎯 Purpose: Document and test your transformed models (staging, dims, facts, marts).
📍 Location: Co-located with models (e.g., models/staging/schema.yml, models/core/schema.yml) — committed to Git.
 and You now know your data is clean — or exactly where it’s broken.

 5.abt the folder core/
 that have the the clean data in dim and fact 
 design the link between them 

6.Macros/: put in it functions with params in each dataset that we need in our mean code 
and to avoid repetition in jinja or sql

7.Data lineage is the end-to-end tracking of data flow: 
from raw source 
→ transformations (dbt models) 
→ final dashboards (e.g., Looker, Tableau).
for seeing why this kpi for example wrong ?
or test what breaks when i change this or this ?

8.staging/ folder for 
Standardize & clean raw inputs

9.core/ folder conform to dimensions and fact

10.marts/ folder :answer specific business questions kpi (revenue, retention, etc.)


11.dev env :the developper use to test logic or add new logic
12.staging env : Full end-to-end test (sources → marts) the use use it 
13.prod env : Production — serving business decisions ,Used by dashboards, ML models, APIs

14.dbt run -s dim_products vs dbt test -s dim_products:

14.1 dbt run -s dim_products
Executes the SQL in
dim_products.sql
→ creates/refreshes the table in BigQuery
BigQuery:
dev_sales_dw.core_dim_products


14.2 dbt test -s dim_products
Runs data quality tests
checks uniqueness, nulls, relationships
Terminal:
PASS=5 WARN=0 ERROR=0

15.CI (Continuous Integration)

16.CD (Continuous Delivery):
Deploy to staging
After manual approval: deploy to prod

17.After Building the Warehouse: Make It a DevOps Project
but how ?

18.PR Workflow (Step-by-Step)?

19. Deployment Workflow (dev → staging → prod) example sales_dw?
